### How to switch users and *sudo* access

#### Commands covered

- `su - username`
- `sudo <command>`
- `visudo`

#### Relevant file

- **/etc/sudoers**

#### Routine commands to run after login into a *VM*

Since a virtual machine is used for all the sections and exercises, 
one should make sure that the following values are what they should be.

##### Which user am I?

```bash
~ $ whoami
tklein
~ $ 
```

##### What is my current absolute *path*?

```bash
~ $ pwd
/home/tklein
~ $ 
```

##### On which *host* am I currently?

```bash
~ $ hostname
localhost.localdomain
~ $ 
```

#### *su* and *sudo*

**Command:** `su - username` 

One enters the 'username' of the account one wants to become. If left blank,
it defaults to 'username' == *root*

Becoming user *root* and staying root until one decides to *exit* the root account,
is done like demonstrated below. One must have sufficient permissions to become root and know the password for the 
root user account.

```bash
~ $ su -
Password: 
Last login: Sun Dec 26 23:05:13 CET 2021 on pts/0
root * 
```
While root, one can change into any other *username*, without being prompted to enter that *username's* password.  

```bash
~ $ su -
Password: 
Last login: Mon Dec 27 09:56:48 CET 2021 on pts/0
root * su - kate
[kate@localhost ~]$ 
```

Exiting the root account again is done by entering `exit` after one's prompt.

```bash
root * exit
logout
~ $ whoami
tklein
~ $ 
```

**Command:** `sudo <command>`

The `sudo` command lets a user, who can not become *root* himself. It allows such a user
to run commands, that only user *root* can run usually, if they are in group *wheel* for example or in the **sudoers** file.

Two commands that can only be run by *root* are `dmidecode` and `fdisk -l`, to run these one has to 

```bash
~ $ dmidecode
# dmidecode 3.2
/sys/firmware/dmi/tables/smbios_entry_point: Permission denied
Scanning /dev/mem for entry point.
/dev/mem: Permission denied
~ $ fdisk -l
fdisk: cannot open /dev/sda: Permission denied
fdisk: cannot open /dev/mapper/centos-root: Permission denied
fdisk: cannot open /dev/mapper/centos-swap: Permission denied
~ $ 
```

One can add or change the permissions that a user has, to let them become root for example or
to let them run any command in the shell, if they are a member of group *wheel* by default.

##### Example

The example comes from a file that can be accessed by running `visudo` with *root* priviledges.

```bash
## Allow root to run any commands anywhere
root    ALL=(ALL)       ALL
will    ALL=(ALL)       ALL # Only an example
## Allows people in group wheel to run all commands
%wheel  ALL=(ALL)       ALL
## Same thing without a password
# %wheel        ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
```

###### Adding account 'tklein' to group *wheel*

```bash
root * usermod -aG wheel tklein
root * 
```

###### Verification

- Using `id <username>` one gets all the groups the user is a member of.
- `grep "wheel" /etc/group` will print a line from the */etc/group* file, to verify the changes.

```bash
root * id tklein
uid=1000(tklein) gid=1000(tklein) groups=1000(tklein),10(wheel)
root * grep "wheel" /etc/group
wheel:x:10:tklein
root * 
```
