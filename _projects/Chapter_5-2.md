### Differences between vi and vim Editor

> As far as functionality is concerned, both editors work in the same manner. Which editor one chooses is a matter of personal choice. Some people recommend learning the vim editor instead of the vi editor. Due to added features and using vim editor is much easier than the vi editor. *Iafzal*

- Some older operating systems have vi support, but not vim support.
- vim has many more features compared to vi, which means that if one is familiar with vim, having to use vi in certain situations is not a problem.
- vim has all the features, that vi has with some excellent additions.
- There is also a comprehensive help system built into vim and there are lots of options when it comes to customising vim as well.
